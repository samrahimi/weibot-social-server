This is a simple node / express app that generates mock static webpages representing the 
contents of posts and searches on WeiBlocked. When a user shares a post or search query 
from the WeiBlocked dApp, it provides the social media platform with the corresponding 
route on this service. This allows Facebook and Twitter bots to scrape dynamic content 
and generate meaningful cards and previews, despite the core app being serverless.
